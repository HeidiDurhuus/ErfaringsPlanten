    hook: "Today, 75% of the worlds food is generated from 12 plants and 5 animal species. This is not robust. There are about 250.000 edible plants in the world.",

    approach: "The aim is to build up this knowledge fast with a citizen science approach.",
    benefit:  "This is achieved by letting users log their plants growing condition, how its harvested and prepared to eat. Users will also share logs that match their plants.",
    competition: "There are some extensive databases online, and also garden diaries and plant identification apps. The Knowledge Plant compliments these resources.",
    close: "Like the cookbook was in every kitchen, this app should be the new companion.",
    acknowledge1: "Thank you to The Danish Seed Savers for good help in finding plantnamelists.",
    technical: "This web app is developed using the Meteor platform, and is styled using Twitter Bootstrap."
